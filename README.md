# AI-HEALTHCARE-CHATBOT

An AI healthcare chatbot is a digital assistant designed to help users with healthcare-related inquiries and tasks, powered by artificial intelligence. These chatbots can simulate conversations with human users and are commonly used in various healthcare settings to provide support, advice, and guidance. They can assist with everything from offering basic medical information to scheduling appointments and providing mental health support.
Symptom Checking: Many healthcare chatbots can analyze symptoms input by the user and suggest potential conditions, helping users determine whether they should seek further medical attention.
Appointment Scheduling: Chatbots can help patients book appointments with doctors or specialists, saving time and reducing administrative work for healthcare facilities.
While AI healthcare chatbots can provide valuable assistance, they should always complement professional healthcare, not replace it. For more serious or urgent medical issues, it is always important to consult a healthcare provider directly.
